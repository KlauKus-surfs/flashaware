The risk engine and the data-retention job are gated behind a Postgres
advisory lock (`server/leader.ts`) so only one machine in the fleet runs
them. The HTTP API and the WebSocket server run on every machine.

## Risk-engine state machine

Five states. Only `STOP`, `HOLD`, `PREPARE`, and `DEGRADED` are
alert-eligible; alert dispatch logic lives in `riskEngine.runEvaluation`.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> ALL_CLEAR: cold start

  ALL_CLEAR --> PREPARE: prepare_radius flashes ≥ threshold
  ALL_CLEAR --> STOP: stop_radius flashes ≥ threshold OR\nnearest flash < proximity (max(1, stop_radius/2) km)

  PREPARE --> STOP: stop conditions met
  PREPARE --> PREPARE: prepare conditions still met
  PREPARE --> PREPARE: no flashes BUT allclear_wait_min not elapsed
  PREPARE --> ALL_CLEAR: no flashes AND allclear_wait_min elapsed

  STOP --> HOLD: stop conditions clear, prepare still active
  STOP --> HOLD: no flashes BUT allclear_wait_min not elapsed
  STOP --> ALL_CLEAR: no flashes AND allclear_wait_min elapsed

  HOLD --> STOP: stop conditions reappear
  HOLD --> HOLD: prepare conditions still met OR\nallclear_wait_min not elapsed
  HOLD --> ALL_CLEAR: no flashes AND allclear_wait_min elapsed

  ALL_CLEAR --> DEGRADED: data feed stale > 25 min
  PREPARE --> DEGRADED: data feed stale > 25 min
  STOP --> DEGRADED: data feed stale > 25 min
  HOLD --> DEGRADED: data feed stale > 25 min
  DEGRADED --> ALL_CLEAR: feed recovered, prior was non-alert
  DEGRADED --> HOLD: feed recovered, prior was STOP/HOLD/PREPARE
```

The pure decision logic is in `riskEngine.decideRiskState` (testable
without a DB — see `server/tests/riskEngine.test.ts`).

### Hysteresis

Coming down from `STOP`, `HOLD`, or `PREPARE` honours `allclear_wait_min`
(default 30 min) measured from the *most recent* flash inside the stop
radius. Without this, a single trailing flash followed by a brief lull
would oscillate the dashboard between STOP and ALL_CLEAR.

The "effective prior state" used by the wait logic looks back through any
intervening `DEGRADED` rows, so a feed outage doesn't reset the hysteresis
clock.

### Alert gating

| State | Triggers an alert? | Notes |
| ----- | ------------------ | ----- |
| `STOP` | On state change AND on persistence (every `persistence_alert_min`, default 10 min) | Suppressed if `alert_on_change_only` is set on the location |
| `HOLD` | Same as STOP | Same |
| `PREPARE` | On state change only | |
| `DEGRADED` | On state change only | |
| `ALL_CLEAR` | Never (clearing is implicit) | |

Cold start (`previousState=null`) never fires an alert — avoids paging on
deploy.

## Multi-tenancy

Every business table carries `org_id` (UUID, FK to `organisations`).
Routes scope queries to `req.user.org_id` unless the caller is
`super_admin` (which can read across orgs and may pass `?org_id=` to
narrow).

| Layer | Where enforcement lives |
| ----- | ----------------------- |
| HTTP route guards | `server/index.ts` → `requireRole`, `resolveOrgScope`, `getLocationForUser` |
| Query-level | `WHERE l.org_id = $1` clauses in `server/queries.ts` |
| WebSocket | Room `org:<org_id>` joined on connect; `org:__all__` for super-admin |

Soft-deleted orgs (`deleted_at IS NOT NULL`) are excluded from all reads
via the `INNER JOIN organisations o ON o.deleted_at IS NULL` pattern in
`getAllLocations`. They are hard-deleted by the retention job after
`ORG_HARD_DELETE_DAYS` (default 30).

## Data model

```mermaid
erDiagram
  organisations ||--o{ users : "has"
  organisations ||--o{ locations : "owns"
  organisations ||--o{ org_settings : "overrides"
  locations ||--o{ location_recipients : "notifies"
  locations ||--o{ risk_states : "tracks"
  locations ||--o{ alerts : "triggered"
  risk_states ||--o{ alerts : "produces"
  location_recipients ||--o{ recipient_phone_otps : "verifies"
  flash_events }o--|| ingestion_log : "from product"

  organisations {
    uuid id PK
    text name
    text slug
    timestamptz deleted_at
  }
  locations {
    uuid id PK
    uuid org_id FK
    geometry centroid "POINT 4326"
    geometry geom "POLYGON 4326"
    int stop_radius_km
    int prepare_radius_km
    int allclear_wait_min
    int persistence_alert_min
    bool alert_on_change_only
  }
  flash_events {
    bigint flash_id
    text product_id
    geometry geom "POINT 4326"
    timestamptz flash_time_utc
    "UNIQUE(product_id, flash_id)"
  }
  risk_states {
    bigserial id PK
    uuid location_id FK
    text state "ALL_CLEAR/PREPARE/STOP/HOLD/DEGRADED"
    timestamptz evaluated_at
    jsonb reason
  }
  alerts {
    bigserial id PK
    uuid location_id FK
    bigint state_id FK
    text alert_type "system/email/sms/whatsapp"
    text recipient
    text twilio_sid
    timestamptz sent_at
    timestamptz delivered_at
    timestamptz acknowledged_at
    bool escalated
  }
```

PostGIS notes:
- All geometry columns are SRID 4326 (WGS84 lat/lng).
- Distance queries cast to `geography` so PostGIS does great-circle
  distance, not planar.
- Spatial index on `flash_events.geom` is critical — without it the
  `ST_DWithin` queries in the risk engine become full scans.

## WebSocket event catalog

Server → client events. All are namespaced inside the org room
`org:<org_id>` (super-admins additionally join `org:__all__`).

| Event | Purpose | Reliability |
| ----- | ------- | ----------- |
| `risk-state-change` | Per-location state transition | Reliable (must arrive) |
| `alert-triggered` / `alert.triggered` | Alert dispatched (any channel) | Reliable. Both names emitted during client migration |
| `system-health` | Feed health beat | **Volatile** — drops if client buffer is full |
| `error` | Server-side WS error | Reliable |

Client → server:

| Event | Purpose |
| ----- | ------- |
| `join-location` | Subscribe to a specific location's risk-state events |
| `leave-location` | Unsubscribe |

Connection lifecycle:
- Auth via `handshake.auth.token` (JWT) — same secret as HTTP API.
- `pingTimeout: 20s`, `pingInterval: 10s` — stalled clients evicted within ~30s.
- Single-machine fan-out today. **For Fly.io scale-out a Redis adapter
  is required** — see `server/websocket.ts` initialize() for the hook
  point.

## Ingestion pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  Loop[Collector loop<br/>INGESTION_INTERVAL_SEC=120]
  Discover[discover_products<br/>last 30 min<br/>3-attempt backoff]
  Skip{Already in<br/>ingestion_log?}
  Download[download_product<br/>3-attempt backoff]
  Parse[parse_body_nc<br/>netCDF4 → flash dicts]
  Insert[bulk_insert_flashes<br/>ON CONFLICT product_id,flash_id]
  Log[INSERT ingestion_log<br/>ON CONFLICT product_id]
  State[Persist last_ingested_product_id<br/>collector_state.json]

  Loop --> Discover
  Discover --> Skip
  Skip -->|yes| Loop
  Skip -->|no| Download
  Download --> Parse
  Parse --> Insert
  Insert --> Log
  Log --> State
  State --> Loop
```

Idempotency at three levels:
1. **Collector pre-check** — query `ingestion_log` for already-seen
   `product_id`s before downloading (saves bandwidth on restart).
2. **Bulk insert** — `ON CONFLICT (product_id, flash_id) DO NOTHING`
   guarantees no double-counting even on overlapping batches.
3. **Ingestion log** — `ON CONFLICT (product_id) DO UPDATE` updates the
   QC status if the product is re-ingested.

Failure modes:
- **EUMETSAT API timeout / 5xx** → 3 attempts with 2s/4s/8s backoff,
  then logged and the cycle moves on. Next cycle (120s) tries again.
- **Missing credentials** → ERROR log in production, WARN in dev.
  Collector keeps looping but every cycle is a no-op.
- **Mid-batch crash** → `last_ingested_product_id` is persisted after
  each successful product, so the next run resumes there.
- **>10 consecutive cycle failures** → process exits with code 1 so
  Fly.io restarts it.

## Key non-obvious behaviours

These are the things that surprise new contributors. Search for the
listed file/function for the implementation.

| Behaviour | Where |
| --------- | ----- |
| Risk-engine and retention are leader-only (advisory lock) | `server/leader.ts`, `startLeaderJobs` in `index.ts` |
| WebSocket fan-out is single-machine; followers don't see leader's broadcasts | `server/websocket.ts` (TODO: Redis adapter) |
| `parseCentroid` returns `(0,0)` and warns on malformed WKT — never throws | `server/db.ts` |
| Effective prior state skips DEGRADED rows for hysteresis | `riskEngine.evaluateLocation` |
| Cold start (previousState=null) suppresses the very first alert | `riskEngine.runEvaluation` |
| PII is scrubbed from `alerts` at 7 days, full-deleted at 30 | `runRetention` in `index.ts` |
| Audit log retention is `max(DATA_RETENTION_DAYS, 90)` | same |
| WebSocket `system-health` is volatile (drops under backpressure); `risk-state-change` is reliable | `server/websocket.ts` |
